								<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
								<p><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</b><br>
									My interest in IT started when I was very young, around the age of ten. I have grown up with computers my whole life, using a ThinkPad as my gaming station, and progressing through different laptops then eventually to gaming PCs. I have noticed throughout my years that everytime my electronic devices had a problem I enjoyed taking the time to accurately locate and fix the problem, this was a particular interest of mine that was like no other. I also helped many friends and	family dissolve problems they encountered which also brought me to realise my interest in Information Technology.
								<p><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b><br>
									The one person that majorly sparked my interest in IT was my cousin. He achieved a 98 ATAR, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at RMIT. Ever since I was young, I always looked up to him as a role model. At the choosing of my courses, I asked him for advice on doing IT or Computer Science as a career path. After interviewing him about his career, such as questions relating to what qualities you will need, what difficulties you will face, his answers changed my whole career path from originally wanting to do a Bachelors of Applied Logistics and Supply-chain management to IT. I would have loved to do Computer Science, however I did not do methods and there was no pathway to enter a computer science degree, so IT ended up being my top choice - and alot of computer-science related jobs also accept a Bachelors of IT as it’s qualification.
</p>
								<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br>
								I chose to attend RMIT for its robust availability of facilities and equipment, as well as it’s experienced staff members that will help me during my completion of this course. It was also in a more convenient location to access as opposed to other universities like Monash, where I got offered a Bachelor of IT there as well in the Clayton campus. However as I am from the Northern suburbs, I figured the travel wasn’t worth it and RMIT had many vouches and recommendations as a top-tier university.

								<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br>
								I expect to learn many qualities and skills obviously relating to IT, such as Programming, Networking, Data communication, Linux, Java, and HTML. I wish to relay these skills in finding a career relating to IT, as it will benefit me greatly. As IT is a generally new subject to me, building these skills and further developing them throughout the course are of great interest to me.

				</div>
			<b>		What do the results of these tests mean for you? </b> <br>
				I find the results of these tests very interesting, as they provide meaningful, honest results to reveal what type of personality one has, as one person may have thought they were an extrovert but is an actual introvert at heart. The results of tests such as the online learning style test is also very beneficial, as everyone’s learning style is unique and different. These websites help to accommodate for that and further benefit students such as myself in their studies. At heart though, I do not 100% believe the accuracy of these tests as everyone is different, and the studies to accommodate for every person in the world would be highly difficult.
			<br>	<b>	How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </b> <br>
				As a mostly individual learner myself, these results can actually prove to be beneficial in a team environment to see if there are any outstanding problems with myself as a team worker that my team may be too afraid to address. It will help increase productivity within the team and help achieve our goals much easier, if everyone understands each other well and personalities don’t collide.
			<br>	<b>	How should you take this into account when forming a team? </b><br>
				If you were to fully follow a personality test to form a team, I believe it wouldn’t be very effective and successful, however it can be used as a basis to outline what type of learner and personality each of your team members have to further your understanding and synergy with them. Being a ‘commander’ personality myself, it demonstrates I should show leadership within my team, however if there is another ‘commander’ we may collide or have conflicting ideas.

<section class="Project Idea">
								<h2>Project Idea</h2>
			<b>Overview</b>
		<br>		My project idea is a Covid-19 Check-in app, where users will be able to scan QR/enter access codes to check in a particular place by using the mobile’s location, time, contact and name. Businesses will need to register their name with the tracking app in order to generate a QR/access code for users to check in, and it will be as simple as entering a form that will be able to save the users’ details for further use. The app will be able to track when, who and where signed into a place in order to help track-down any potential covid-19 cases.
		<br><b>Motivation</b>
		<br>The idea of this project came from when restaurants/businesses started re-opening after lockdown and used pen and paper to track individuals. I thought it would be a great idea to create an application that gives the user’s time, location and contact details at the click of a button or scanning of a QR code to aid with contact tracing and to keep individuals safe. Not long ago, Service Victoria created a check-in app that is very similar to my project idea.
		<br><b>Description</b>
		<br><li>The application will be free on Android (Google Play) & IOS (App store), provided users have a wifi/internet connection to download the app.
<li>			Users must be over 12 years of age to register, and any children will be required to check-in via their guardian’s check-in process as there will be a prompt asking if there are any dependent child(s) with them.
<li>			The application will be modern and easy to navigate, with a simple ‘fill-the-survey’ type navigation and it’s done. The application will prompt everything the user has to input, and users/businesses will be registered easily.
<li>			Users will need to grant the app access to its location, whether it be while the app is open or unlimited access.
<li>			Users will need to enter the name, contact details and address at the time of registration - but when scanning/inputting the code the details will automatically be filled in and they will only need to press ‘Check-in’.
<li>			Mobile phones will need to have a QR scanning function with their camera in order to scan, however an access code will also be provided in case users do not have this function.
<li>			A QR Code/Access code will be provided by businesses that users can  either scan or enter
<li>			Businesses will need to register their location(s), and primary contact (whether it be the manager, owner), and the app will generate a QR code that each location will be able to use indefinitely.
<li>			After businesses register, the QR/access code poster will be sent to the user's email and they can then print out the code to display  in the front of their building.
<li>			Dark/light mode will be added to help visibility, and aid in appearances.
<li>			Only your name and phone number will be provided at each check-in process to help secure privacy, but registering an account will require personal details.
<li>			To secure users information and privacy, if there are no cases/contact tracing linked within 14 days of the building the users check-in details will automatically be deleted.

		<br><b>Tools and Technologies</b>
		<br>
I will require mobile development tools such as;
<li>		Android Studio (developed by Google)
<li>		AppCode (it supports programming languages and web technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, XML, CSS and more)
<li>		Cross-platform tools such as Xamarin which may help lessen the time taken to create the application as it will be native across iOS, Android and Windows applications.
<br>The hardware I need will be:
<li>My personal computer and laptop to be able to work on the application far from home if needed.
<li>Mobile phone
<li>Printer to print out the QR poster
<li>Test users, to input a fake business and checking in with the QR/Access code.

		<br><b>Skills required</b>
		<br>The skills that are required for this application are;
<li>	Software/mobile development skills
<li>	Mathematical aptitude
<li>	Problem-solving skills
<li>	Programming languages (such as Python, Java, CSS, HTML)
<br>	Organisational and time-management skills
<li>	To be able to obtain these skills, I must go through teaching courses and keep up with my studies in my degree in order to produce a higher output application to the best of my ability. It will be difficult for me to learn software development as it is a new subject, however I believe it is not impossible and will be a very fun and intriguing challenge.

		<br><b>Outcome</b>
		<br>If this project is successful, it can help many businesses and governments to contact-trace individuals that may have been in contact with a covid-19 case. With the simplicity of the app, it will be very easy to scan and check in locations without needing to write down on pen & paper. Though the development of this application is very similar to the Services Victoria check-in app, there are still many businesses out there that have not registered with Services Victoria.
		<br><b>Any potential drawbacks?</b>
<br>		The potential drawbacks in creating this project would be;
<li>The access to mobile development tools/tutorials, as it will most likely cost me out-of-pocket expenses in order to teach myself coding as well as using mobile developers.
<li>The current skills I have are not capable enough to create the application, and even though I may be able to create the application, if I run into any problems I may not be able to fix it without the help of a professional app developer.
