								<h2>Personal Information</h2>
								<p><b>Student number:</b> s3902169 <br>
									<b>Student email:</b> s3902169@student.rmit.edu.au <br>
									<b><i>Background Information</i></b> <br>
									<b>Nationality:</b> Born and raised in Australia.<br>
									<b>Ethnicity:</b> Half Vietnamese, Half Timorese. My mother was born in East-Timor, whereas my father was born in Vietnam. <br>
									<b>Education to date:</b> Completed VCE Year 12, graduated with a 72.3 ATAR. Currently studying my first year of Bachelor of IT at RMIT. <br>
									<b>Languages Spoken:</b> Hakka, Vietnamese, English <br>
									<b>Hobbies:</b>

							<li>I have also recently gained an interest in cars as well. I recently bought a vehicle, a Toyota 86, and have added various mods/self-serviced it and was a very fun and enjoyable experience.

</p>
								<h2>Interest in IT</h2>
								<p><b>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?</b><br>
									My interest in IT started when I was very young, around the age of ten. I have grown up with computers my whole life, using a ThinkPad as my gaming station, and progressing through different laptops then eventually to gaming PCs. I have noticed throughout my years that everytime my electronic devices had a problem I enjoyed taking the time to accurately locate and fix the problem, this was a particular interest of mine that was like no other. I also helped many friends and	family dissolve problems they encountered which also brought me to realise my interest in Information Technology.
								<p><b>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).</b><br>
									The one person that majorly sparked my interest in IT was my cousin. He achieved a 98 ATAR, and graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at RMIT. Ever since I was young, I always looked up to him as a role model. At the choosing of my courses, I asked him for advice on doing IT or Computer Science as a career path. After interviewing him about his career, such as questions relating to what qualities you will need, what difficulties you will face, his answers changed my whole career path from originally wanting to do a Bachelors of Applied Logistics and Supply-chain management to IT. I would have loved to do Computer Science, however I did not do methods and there was no pathway to enter a computer science degree, so IT ended up being my top choice - and alot of computer-science related jobs also accept a Bachelors of IT as it’s qualification.
</p>
								<p><b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</b><br>
								I chose to attend RMIT for its robust availability of facilities and equipment, as well as it’s experienced staff members that will help me during my completion of this course. It was also in a more convenient location to access as opposed to other universities like Monash, where I got offered a Bachelor of IT there as well in the Clayton campus. However as I am from the Northern suburbs, I figured the travel wasn’t worth it and RMIT had many vouches and recommendations as a top-tier university.

								<p><b>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</b><br>
								I expect to learn many qualities and skills obviously relating to IT, such as Programming, Networking, Data communication, Linux, Java, and HTML. I wish to relay these skills in finding a career relating to IT, as it will benefit me greatly. As IT is a generally new subject to me, building these skills and further developing them throughout the course are of great interest to me.

								<p>My ideal job would be a network engineer. A network engineer is responsible for the planning, development and implementation of computer network and system services, as well as troubleshooting problems relating to them.
			<br>				What makes this job appealing to me is the troubleshooting of problems relating to its network system services, as I relatively find fixing problems very interesting and satisfying ever since a young age.

					<br><b>	How will you plan to obtain these skills? </b>
<br>								The plan to obtain these skills have been sketched and aided through the course plan of the Bachelors of IT degree. Advanced/minor IT options such as Further programming, Network programming, Security testing and minor study streams (such as CISCO Systems Minor which includes Networking/Advanced Networking) will greatly help in obtaining these skills required to efficiently and effectively become a network engineer.
										To further develop skills such as communication and working in a group, I am planning to find entry-level IT jobs such as Help Desks and Supports in Year Two of my program (as I will have deeper knowledge of IT than I have currently) in different companies to get familiar with an IT environment and to further refine my current abilities.
										However, this is still a plan and may still change as I progress through my course and find something more interesting/befitting.
